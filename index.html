        <div class="about-me_body">

            <p> Hello world, I’m Alex - a coder and trainee software developer from Leeds. 
                I am currently a Northcoders student enrolled on the remote bootcamp, an experience 
                that has sparked a deep love of programming and a tolerant indifference to Zoom.</p>

            <p> I was previously a sports performance analyst - a position that allowed me to travel 
                to different countries and work with lots of interesting people. This is also where I 
                discovered a passion for problem solving and creative thinking! As someone who has always 
                had an enthusiasm for technology and an obsession over detail, learning to code felt like 
                the obvious next step to take as I sought a new challenge in my working life. Having spoken 
                to a couple of previous Northcoders graduates, the glow on their (digital) faces when they 
                spoke about their bootcamp experience and subsequent roles was all the convincing I needed 
                to take the leap!</p>

            <p> I love collaborating with others on projects, something that was nurtured as I grew up 
                playing in a variety of different musical outfits - I’ve played percussion in jazz groups 
                and guitar in noisy metal bands! My other big source of joy in life is cricket; while I 
                am a pretty ordinary batsman even on my better days, the sport has instilled in me the 
                importance of a positive mindset, fairness, honesty and respect for others. These are all 
                values I bring to my professional life as well, making me a valuable team member and amiable 
                colleague.</p>
                
            <p> Feel free to get in touch, I’m very easy-going (as long as I’ve had a cup of coffee!). You can click the contact icons below.</p>
